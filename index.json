Unlike  traditional growth models that emphasize market expansion or operational efficiency,  SORE Theory underscores proactive adaptability, layered redundancy, and evolution  through adversity as critical elements for sustainable business practices.

    "description": "This paper explores Marianne Williamson's iconic quote beginning with \"Our deepest fear  is not that we are inadequate...\" as a foundational text for understanding personal  empowerment, societal conditioning, and spiritual philosophy. Through a multidisciplinary  approach spanning psychology, philosophy, education, leadership, and theology, this  research situates Williamson's passage within broader frameworks of self-actualization,  humanistic psychology, liberation theology, and transformative leadership. By analyzing the  rhetorical construction, historical misattribution, and enduring cultural impact of this  quote, the paper highlights its role as a catalyst for personal and collective awakening. The  paper concludes by arguing for the quote's relevance in contemporary discourse on  identity, potential, and service.",
